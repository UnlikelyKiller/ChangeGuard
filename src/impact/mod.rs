//! Impact Analysis Module
//!
//! This module is the core of ChangeGuard's change intelligence pipeline. It is responsible
//! for transforming raw repository changes into a structured, enriched `ImpactPacket`.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! The pipeline follows an **Orchestrator-Provider pattern**:
//!
//! 1. **Snapshot → Packet** (`orchestrator::map_snapshot_to_packet`):
//!    A `git::RepoSnapshot` is converted into an `ImpactPacket`. During this phase,
//!    file-level analysis (symbol extraction, import parsing, runtime usage detection)
//!    is performed via `index::analysis::analyze_file`.
//!
//! 2. **Orchestration** (`orchestrator::ImpactOrchestrator`):
//!    The orchestrator manages the lifecycle of enrichment providers. It builds an
//!    `EnrichmentContext` (database handle, file ID map, project root, config) and
//!    executes each registered provider in sequence.
//!
//! 3. **Enrichment** (`enrichment::*`):
//!    Modular providers contribute domain-specific data to the `ImpactPacket`:
//!    - **API** — route and contract enrichment
//!    - **Observability** — Prometheus and log-scraping signals
//!    - **Coupling** — structural, temporal, and data-flow coupling
//!    - **Services** — service map derivation and cross-service edges
//!    - **Infrastructure** — topology and deployment manifest detection
//!    - **Risk** — final risk scoring and elevation
//!    - ...and others.
//!
//!    Each provider implements the `EnrichmentProvider` trait. Failures are isolated:
//!    if one provider fails, the orchestrator logs a warning and continues with the
//!    remaining providers (graceful degradation).
//!
//! 4. **Finalization** (`packet::ImpactPacket::finalize`):
//!    After all providers complete, the packet is finalized: collections are sorted,
//!    truncation budgets are applied, and deterministic ordering is enforced.
//!
//! 5. **Redaction** (`redact::redact_secrets`):
//!    Sensitive values are removed from the packet before persistence.
//!
//! 6. **Persistence** (`state::storage`):
//!    The finalized packet is saved to SQLite and optionally to the ledger.
//!
//! ## Determinism Contract
//!
//! All collections emitted by the impact pipeline are sorted. Risk levels, temporal
//! couplings, and hotspot rankings use stable, comparable ordering to ensure that
//! repeated runs on identical inputs produce identical outputs.
//!
//! ## Testing
//!
//! - Unit tests for individual enrichment providers use in-memory SQLite with
//!   mocked storage states.
//! - Integration tests (`tests/risk_analysis.rs`, `tests/temporal_coupling.rs`)
//!   verify end-to-end correctness.
//! - The orchestrator's resilient execution is tested by verifying that a failing
//!   provider does not prevent other providers from completing.
